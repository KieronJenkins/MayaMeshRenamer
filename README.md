## About
The Maya Mesh Renamer was created using Python to simply allow the user to select and rename objects or use standard prefix/suffix names. Nothing more, nothing less. 
Not the fanciest of projects but it gets the job done.

## Two Main Objectives
1. Allow the user to rename an object quickly and easily.
2. Have a compact UI that is simple to use.

## Using The Renamer
To use the renamer an artist must first create a button on their custom Maya shelf and set that button to work with Python, not MEL, once set up the user can simply click the assigned button, a window will pop up with three areas to enter text (Name, Prefix and Suffix) or you can select a standard Prefix/Suffix, underscores get added automatically.

## Why Create a Renamer
Ultimately it isn't the most impressive tool around however I decided it would be a nice project to do and who doesn't want to batch rename things.
